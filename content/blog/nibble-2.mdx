👋🏻 Hola! Welcome to the #2 edition of Nibbles.

### News 🗞️

*   ✨ Recent YC Batch has a 1.4% acceptance rate, here's a quick look at them, complete the dataset [here](https://app.launchgravity.com/data-drops/y-combinator-winter-2023-batch)
    
*   Talking about YC, someone created a Chatbot exclusively for YC's Knowledge base so that you can ask your doubts to it. [Try it](https://yc-knowledge-app.vercel.app/)
    
*   🚀 Chome ships WebGPU **\[**[**Link**](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webgpu-release/)**\]** (_so, now you can develop more graphic-intensive shitty stuff and fill the web with that to poison DALL-E too_)
    
*   🐣 Twitter chooses a bad-ass way _again_ to hunt down the leaker \[[Link](https://theintercept.com/2023/04/08/twitter-dmca-github-musk/)\] (_definitely, not the first time Elon is doing this sort of sorcery, also I like how the "The Intercept" has a section at the end "****Takeaways for Leakers****"_ 🤣)
    
*   🏞️ Well, well, well, Guess who is back (_It's Zuck Meta_), Meta released [SAM (Segment Anything Model)](https://segment-anything.com/demo) which recognizes a different object in an image with mind-blowing accuracy. It has been trained over 11M images. (_so, yes our FB Images are being put to good use and what's this obsession of AI tool names with SAM\{a\}_)
    
*   💰 Meet [Pull](https://www.pullnow.com/), a company that lets you withdraw up to 6 months' salary in advance with a 3% fee and no interest (_BNPL was definitely a mess here in India, but these guys took this to next level, also the domain reminds of some of the scariest order I have been given_)
    

### Wild World & Web 🫠

*   🐆 Meet [Cheetah](https://github.com/leetcode-mafia/cheetah), a Whisper & GPT-based app for passing remote SWE interviews (_looking forward to the era where we'll interview LLMs and enjoy this all self-deprecating humor, joke apart it's getting really scary down here, do you guys have a link to Farming Tutorials?_)
    
*   📺 Meet [More Episodes!](https://moreepisodes.com/), it's a tool that generates the natural extension episodes to your favorite shows. (_Finished watching a TV Series, wishing that there should have been more episodes of the same. Worry not. GPT-4 has got you covered)_
    
*   💬 [Ask HN: What lesser-known accessories do you use with your computer?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35429801) (_yup! the idea is to find the devices to burn money, if you still have doubts, I know a_ [_guy_](https://twitter.com/avtansk))
    
*   🌉 Have you ever wondered why the Golden Gate Bridge is called "Golden Gate" when it's not Golden and not even Gate? - \[[Link](https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/why-isnt-the-golden-gate-bridge-gold/)\] (_we might do one nomenclature link in every post, I know tons more of them_)
    
*   🐦‍⬛ [How Killing Sparrows Led to Great Famines in China](https://www.historydefined.net/how-killing-sparrows-led-to-one-of-the-greatest-famines-in-history/) (_this post is a quick reminder of how all the species on this planet live in harmony and why you shouldn't mess with things you don't understand_) - Shared by [Divyesh](http://divye.sh/)
    

### Catch up with the tech 🤓

*   Why you should avoid HTTP3 for some time? ⚠️ - [Link](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/AvoidingHTTP3ForNow) (_TLDR; your container's OS might be a bottleneck_)
    
*   A COBOD Printer is being used to print a 2-Story 3D building in Namma Bengaluru, also, the first in India 🖨️🏚️. (_yup, forget Indiranagar roads, let's focus on what's easy first, huh!_) - [Link](https://www.3dnatives.com/en/cobod-printer-used-for-indias-first-2-story-3d-printed-building-180120216/#!)
    
*   Learn Quantum Computing with IQM Academy's [Curriculum](https://academy.meetiqm.com/curriculum/index.html) (_really can't wait for these chips to be GA and then go again re-inventing all of the cryptography_)
    
*   🧵 [Tech Opportunities you can't afford to miss in April](https://twitter.com/TiyaTwts/status/1646219314788278277)
    

### "Today I Learned" moments 🤯

*   `NaN` always had a complicated relationship with `NaN`, `indexOf` joins the party as the third wheel.

*   You have the BTC whitepaper 📃 hidden on your Mac, you can open that right now using  
    `open /System/Library/Image\ Capture/Devices/VirtualScanner.app/Contents/Resources/simpledoc.pdf`

*   `@here` only notifies all online members of the channel, while `@channel` or `@all` notifies everyone in the channel 🔔 (_been bombing 5 timezones at work lately, gotta keep it to wakey ones from now on._)
    

### New tools in town 👀

*   [EnhanceAI](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/enhance-ai) lets you quickly add autocomplete using AI in your applications (_shorter sprints for such features now_)
    
*   [PWA Builder](https://web.dev/pwas-in-app-stores/) helps you to build packages out of PWA that can be distributed to Google, MS & Apple Store (_so, we have 1 good and 1 bad news, it'll be easy to distribute your web apps and it'll be easy to distribute your web apps_)
    
*   [Freefy](https://freefy.app/) lets you stream music without ads in between (_it is open source, and uses APIs from YT & Spotify for the sole purpose of being an alternative_ 👏🏻)
    
*   [MemeCam](https://www.memecam.io/) allows you to generate a meme from any image, just upload it and it'll add some funny and relevant text on top of the image (_Content Creator era what??_)
    
*   [Copilot for Dating](https://copilot4dating.com/): Having a hard time breaking the ice? (_I don't know where this thing will stop_)
    
*   [ToolBuilder](https://toolbuilder.ai/), this scary tool allows you to generate AI Tools just by using prompts. (_NGL, this one is scary, I wanted to build an Ingredient based recipe finder and I gave it the prompt, it took less than 5 seconds to give me a functional app_)

### Tools Recommendations 💫

*   [RClone](https://rclone.org/): a CLI tool to manage your files on the cloud that supports all major storage providers (_this one has a crazy amount of features in it, oh! and yes it comes with an experimental Web-based GUI too_)
    
*   [ProxyMan](https://proxyman.io/): A simple tool that lets you monitor all the network requests going out from your computer (_this is pretty nifty at times, it basically creates a proxy that gives you the ability to intercept all the requests, save lives & hack stuff sometimes too_)
    
*   [Gamma](https://gamma.app/): It's a new way to communicate ideas, I have been using this at work for a while. (_can't say it'll replace any app from your workflow, but you can try it out_)
    

### Watching 📺

*   [AlphaGo - The Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) - this one will surprisingly bring water to your eyes, it's one hell of a gripping documentary, and also reminds us of how early we started addressing AI as some unpredictable human (_I mean long before GeePeeTee_)
    
*   [Why π is in the normal distribution by 3B1B](https://youtu.be/cy8r7WSuT1I) (_this stuff I don't know should have been part of my degree, but anyways YT University it is!_)
    

### Meme of the week

### Quote of the week

> "The world will ask you who you are, and if you don't know, the world will tell you."  
> ~ Carl Jung

### Note

This newsletter might be a little stale, but the next one will come a little early as I want to keep it shorter and we are lagging by a week.  
Also, I know some of you told me to tweak the banner designs a bit, I'll try to get it done by the next one.
