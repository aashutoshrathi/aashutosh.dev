🙏🏻 Namaste! Welcome to the #3 edition of Nibble.

Yup! This time we are a little early but didn't want to make this thing too big, so it's better to increase frequency than content

### News 🗞️

*   ✨After SAM, last week, we now have [Inst-Inpaint](http://instinpaint.abyildirim.com/), a paper on **Instructing to Remove Objects with Diffusion Models** - [Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/abyildirim/inst-inpaint) (_I feel sad for the image editors on Twitter whose only work was to remove background objects from the images of people and get some Karma points_)

*   🗼[OpenAI Plans for Japan Expansion](https://archive.ph/upxPn) (_I knew it, how can a guy have his username as "sama" and not be a weeb, I think Altman beats_ [_Anshuman_](https://anshumanv.dev/) _in terms of love for Japan_)
    
*   🐛💰 [OpenAI announces Bug Bounty Program with $20k in rewards for reporters](https://archive.ph/k5RyH) (_I hope they are not allowing infra issues_ 😂\*, else it'll be the costliest way to fix Azure\*)
    
*   🥁Welcome [Mullvad Browser, Tor's new pet project](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/3/23665477/mullvad-browser-tor-vpn-privacy-browser) centering privacy without the Onion network (_first, the name is weird, second_ **_Jains_** _might celebrate this news_)

*   😧 [Google is _finally_ going to bring AI to search](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/technology/google-search-engine-ai.html) (_Samsung's move is worrying for them as it's ~1B users, but I'm not sure how they'll make money people will get answers without clicking links_ 🤷🏻‍♂️)
    

### Wild World & Web 🫠

*   🔭 JWT (_no, not your token James Webb Telescope_) spots surprisingly massive galaxies in the early universe. \[[Article](https://phys.org/news/2023-02-webb-massive-galaxies-early-universe.html)\] (_is it time to reconsider the Big Bang theory??_)
    
*   🧩 Do you know the difference between `==` and `===` in JS, yes, right? Here's a quick Windows 9x-style game for you: [EqEq](https://eqeq.js.org/) (_ah! This game will make you feel very smart or very dumb, there is no in-between_)
    
*   📸 [You Can Make a Netflix Style Doco About Literally Anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BUrNe3Vhtk) by Paul E.T. \[**a very kewl video editor**\] (_okay, this guy nailed it, by the time I saw the plate in this video, I completely forgot that I was not on Netflix, also, for some reason these 4 and half a minute feel like lot more_)
    
*   🥘 [How one of our "Bose" created the best-selling dish in Japan](https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/indo-curry/), the `"jun indo kari-" (pure Indian curry)` (_NGL, I was very confused at first, is this SC Bose, but thankfully no!_)
    
*   🌊 [Are sea levels rising the same all over the world, as if we're filling a giant bathtub?](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/faq/9/are-sea-levels-rising-the-same-all-over-the-world-as-if-were-filling-a-giant-bathtub/) (_this could also go in TIL, but this is very hard to digest for me, but that's why we built the engineering marvel, the_ [_Panama Canal_](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/why-was-the-panama-canal-built.html))
    

### Catch up 🤓

*   😶‍🌫️ [What are Transformer Models and How do they work?](https://txt.cohere.ai/what-are-transformer-models/) by Cohere (_look, I think at this point, every edition will have one such post until all of us understand how it works exactly_)  
    \[Bonus: [Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)\]
    
*   📨 It's hard to catch up with AI Tech developments right now, so all you need is [ML Papers of the Week](https://github.com/dair-ai/ML-Papers-of-the-Week)
    
*   🎮 In the last post, we discussed that Chrome shipped WebGPU, but where do you learn stuff about it? Well, here's a resource [WebGPU Fundamentals](https://webgpufundamentals.org/)
    
*   ⚡️ If you already know about [tRPC](https://trpc.io/?ref=aashutosh.dev), and are still not sold. Try reading this post from folks at [unzip.dev](https://unzip.dev/0x012-trpc/) (_Every time I watch or read something about tRPC, I tend to convince my co-worker to use it, this post was not sponsored by_ [_theo.gg_](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg))
    
*   🔐 [SBOM](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom) (Software Bill of Materials) is a new way to keep track of parts/dependencies of your software and how much are they costing you in terms of security. You can read more about it at an amazing compilation of the same by [unzip](https://unzip.dev/0x011-sbom/) folks
    
*   👨🏻‍💻 Our favorite AI tutor **_Andr_**ew**_j_** Ng**_Karpathy_** did a [weekend hack](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1647372603907280896?s=20) to build out [awesome-movies.life](https://awesome-movies.life), a movie search/recommendation engine site. (_Not perfect yet, but works and the chef's kiss UI from the future reminds me of my DLD Lecture Slides from undergrad_)
    

### TILs 🤯

*   🔥 [useEffect sometimes fires before paint](https://blog.thoughtspile.tech/2021/11/15/unintentional-layout-effect/) (_Dan was right, don't use_ `useEffect` _and sleep like a baby at night, or use it and pluck your hair out_)
    
*   ☘️ `null` is the **smallest value in MongoDB**, so only non-existent keys will return `false` on `$gt: [$key, null]`  
    So, if you want to check if a key exists or not, you can use `$gt: [$key, null]`
    
*   **Temptation bundling** is a productivity technique that involves combining an activity that gives you instant gratification. The image below by folks at [Sketchplanations](https://sketchplanations.com/subscribe)

*   [Crown shyness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_shyness) is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other. \[[Tweet](https://twitter.com/8priteshj/status/1647609527376683009?s=20)\]

### New in town 👀

*   **β Apollo,** a ChatGPT-powered app for real-time knowledge. Talk to it all day long through your headphones. \[[DM for TestFlight](https://twitter.com/localghost/status/1644068688902127616?s=20)\]
    
*   🎥 [Figma to Video](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/figma-export-to-video) - a Figma plugin that allows you to export smart animations to GIF or MP4 (_as if prototypes were not enough, now you can send people proto-gifs_)
    
*   🧩 [LiveBlocks](https://liveblocks.io/) - Building Collaborative components in web applications was never easy, but this tool proposes a cool way to make it easy and also claims that you can now build collaborative experiences in days, not months. (my _verdict is it's a super cool product, but it won't always be a breeze using it for complex use cases, I have worked on building Collaborative UIs and they get messy quickly, but LiveBlocks should make easy ones breezy_)
    
*   💸 [Pump](https://www.pump.co) - YC-backed startup that claims to reduce your AWS bill by up to 50% using AI, plus it's free and doesn't require your engineering team (_I hope this ain't true, I know people who worked really hard to optimize AWS bills_)
    

### Recommendations 💫

*   🔎 [Phind](https://www.phind.com/): AI Search engine for developers (_it's not a new tool but in the last 3 months, it has improved a lot, tried to use it for some tasks successfully_)
    
*   🤫 [WhisperBot](https://whisperize.me/), is a WhatsApp bot that sends you transcripts of voice notes. (_so, now you can do dirty confidential talks without making noise_)
    

### Cool OSS Projects 🤌🏻

*   ⏳ [wayback](https://github.com/wabarc/wayback) - A self-hosted archiving service integrated with Internet Archive, [archive.today](http://archive.today), IPFS, and beyond.
    
*   🚀 [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) - It's a better `npm publish` with tons of small tweaks and interactive UI (_and who is a better person to create this than_ [_Almigthy_ Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus), _who used to publish at least one package a day_)

### **Note 👋🏻**

Thanks for reading till here 🙇🏻‍♂️  
We need some feedback here on the format of this newsletter/post.  
We are thinking to add fewer links and more takes, plus moving this to another domain/place, as I have a [co-author](https://www.thepushkarp.com/) with me now.  
We are looking for better alternatives to host this thing also, Hashnode doesn't have the best of things. So, we are open to suggestions.

You can reach out to me using any of the links on the [website](https://aashutosh.dev/)

👋🏻 See you in the next one!
