👋🏻 Hola! Welcome to the #1 edition of Nibble.

Let's make sure we have our seatbelts on, this is gonna be a long & overwhelmingly distracting ride. 🎢

⚠️ **Warning:** it's more like an octet (_instead of a nibble_) now!  
So, I recommend you bookmark this post, in case you can't go through all of them at once.

### News 🗞️

*   ✨ The Microsoft (_creator of my favorite Linux distro,_ [_XP_](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-xp-support-has-ended-47b944b8-f4d3-82f2-9acc-21c79ee6ef5e) 😉) is blowing it off with the new [Loop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop) (_from the looks of it, they are coming after Notion_) & brand new [Teams 2.0](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/microsoft-teams-advantages-of-the-new-architecture/ba-p/3775704) (_you dump, Electron, and/or Angular off your stack, and you get my vote for the elections, dead simple!_)

*   In these [weird AI times](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/7/23587767/microsoft-google-open-ai-battle-search-bing), there is a place where **MS & Google doubles down on bonding**, _yes_ you guessed it right, it's when they are building something against Apple, [Nearby Share Beta lands for Windows](https://blog.google/products/android/nearby-share-windows/), making sharing files between Android and Windows **_seamless_**.

*   Elon open-sourced "[The Algorithm](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm)", and some people built a [visualizer](https://twitter-algorithm.vercel.app/) for it too (_not sure if the visualizer is correct, but people are all over the repo_)

### Catch up with the tech 🤓

*   📹 [Transformers, explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZorAJ4I-sA) by [Dale from Google](https://twitter.com/dalequark), explains how **_Transforms_** work way faster and are more context-aware than RNNs, kudos to **Self-attention** ([AIAYN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762))
    
*   📹 [LLM explainer from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnA9DMvHtfI&t=0s) is by far the best explainer I have seen, the guy takes you from Gradient Descent -> NN -> Transformers -> AGI in a small amount of time.
    
*   📄 [Visual Guide to Event Loop](https://www.builder.io/blog/visual-guide-to-nodejs-event-loop), the core of NodeJS, has always been one of the interesting topics to read, but there are barely any good resources out there on the internet. The folks at [builder.io](https://www.builder.io) have been writing some good technical blogs, no doubt.
    
*   📄 [Cross-browser support landed for Import Maps](https://web.dev/import-maps-in-all-modern-browsers/), a saner way to use ES Modules in browsers, not sure how long the builders gonna last in my stack. You can read why do we care article here
    
*   🐥 [NativeScript announced support for jQuery](https://twitter.com/NativeScript/status/1642059224963485696) (_yup, in 2023_)
    

### "Today I Learned" moments 🤯

*   You can throw `string` instead of `Error` objects in almighty JavaScript. (_I'm at the point in life, where I'm confused if "No Rules, Rules" was deliberately written for JS_)

```javascript
const nibbleOne = () => {
  const nibble = 0x0F;
  // throw new Error('Nibble one'); ✅ works
  // throw "Nibble one"; ✅ works
}
```
        
    
*   **_Do you know how the "auto-adjust backlit brightness"_** ⌨️ **_works?_**  
    this story goes long back (_jk, barely 3 years_) to my undergrad days, I used to think that "nothing was gonna stop me once I got a device with a backlit keyboard", as I can then type like [ThePrimeagen](https://www.twitch.tv/ThePrimeagen) even in the darkest of times.
    
    ![Apple Keyboard Settings](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680427701020/a1d05580-8025-45fe-8cfc-f1f6f2f01d6d.png)
    
    Okay, no worries, you can guess it for the starters.  
    To me, naturally, it makes sense that if I have light in the environment the keyboard's backlit, should dim itself (_as opposed to how we treat screens, right?)_ and once I have low light in the environment the keyboard should litt itself up (_like Louis from Suits exactly opposite of screen_), but **NO**, that's not how it works, at least for Apple.
    
    And knowing this all it's very easy to conclude that it might be that your device is buggy, but worry not, Reddit folks got us covered on this one: [Why your auto-adjust of keyboard backlit might not be working?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/pl2mzq/comment/iavxdht/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
    
*   [Why do you see â€™ instead of an apostrophe](https://www.justinweiss.com/articles/how-to-get-from-theyre-to-theyre/), got a bug at work, where CSVs were behaving like a bad bad boy as they should?
    
*   [ReDoS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS), yup Denial of Services using Regex, and you are more vulnerable to this than you think you are. On a casual Friday walk to AWS Inspector, while at work I saw a [Medium Vuln with word-wrap](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-WORDWRAP-3149973), I quickly dug deeper into this one and found out it's a dependency of **_eslint_** (_so might be affecting half the world_)_._  
    Proposed a fix for this in [this Pull Request](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/word-wrap/pull/33), basically to _avoid using Regex where things can be done without it_.

### New tools in town 👀

*   [CoScreen](https://www.coscreen.co/) by Datadog, beware devs and designers, the hand-holding meme is closer to reality now. Watch the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gltVKtxcM)
    
    ![Pin on Design Memes](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/7c/ae/b8/7caeb8d2e404b301795f86c107c3678a.jpg)
    
*   [Arc for iOS](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23662130/arc-mobile-browser-hands-on-ios), the new browser for _cool kid\*\*_z**, yes it can now be found on [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arc-mobile-companion/id1669785846) and this will be a big step as one missing piece earlier for cross-device sync. I've been using this since its release, if you are still not in yet, here's an [invite](https://arc.net/gift/9c7b51c0).  
    Oh! on that note, you might also want to listen to a Stackoverflow Podcast with Arc Team - \[**The next-gen web browser has no tabs, only spaces (Ep. 549)\*\*\](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/03/28/the-next-gen-web-browser-has-no-tabs-only-spaces-ep-549/)
    
*   [**Regex.ai**](https://regex.ai/)**,** AI-Powered Regular Expression Solver. (_yup! just marked one more skill as irrelevant on my resume_)
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680433893904/e99546e8-ac41-4d84-a097-6805f4aeb8bf.gif)
    

### Tools Recommendations 💫

*   [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (_your own "Dear Diary"_) with [Git Sync Plugin](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) (started post little push and marketing pitch from [Kautuk](https://twitter.com/Kautukkundan) & [only4](http://only4.dev))
    
*   [Rewind](https://www.rewind.ai/) (_imagine, a screen memory with ChatGPT_), found it on Twitter, installed it, and thought would give it a try. But, funny story, in mere 3 days, it saved from unrecoverable states **twice**, one should give it a try _iff_ you trust their [policies](https://www.rewind.ai/privacy-first).
    
*   [Raycast AI](https://www.raycast.com/ai) (_joined the party a little late_)_,_ this is a game changer, you will soon realize how lazy you are as soon as you get access to this, there is no going back to ai.com (_yup, Mr. Altman is doing some serious domain shopping_).
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1680430274383/261d0e93-3fcf-4921-bff8-27205a3a1c8e.png)
    
*   [Hacker News Arc Boost](https://github.com/kslambert/hacker-news-arc-boost), technically it's just a CSS file, but it improves the page so much (_if you are using Arc or not, I recommend injecting this stylesheet_)
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-10-30 at 4 09 30 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3496059/198906404-e67e3e8a-5810-4aa2-8b33-dc3d24c1f485.png)
    

### Fin-bits

(_this section is to share informative things I read, not a fin-fluencer,_ **_yet!!\*_**, so go do your research before trading based on things you read on the internet\*)

*   [Tata Technologies IPO Breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dyo8915RzUU), no doubt this is one of the most exciting IPO coming up, and if you are by any chance like me scarred by [LIC](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/prime/money-and-markets/a-30-fall-since-listing-how-lics-ipo-became-indias-biggest-wealth-destroyer/primearticleshow/92212792.cms) (\*sad crying noises\*), you should give it a try.

### A quote that got me thinking

### Note

Look! this might have been a long one, but trust me when I say this, I _held back from sharing more links_, as it might be redundant for folks who read other newsletters too. 😅  
Also, yes I remember telling you it'll be _4 sections and a quick read_ 🫠, but I think we can't make it smaller if weekly is the frequency we choose. And regarding the shrinking down the sections, I'll work on it in the coming editions.

**On the same note**, I think this one should keep you occupied for a week and a half, as I'll be taking some time off-screen, touching grass ⛵️ for _a week_ exploring 🎒 the beautiful _North Eastern part of India_ 🇮🇳
