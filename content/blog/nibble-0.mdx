👋🏻 Hola, Long time no see! (_first time for most of you TBH_)

### Starting from the start

I have been having _a_ **hard time writing full-blown blog posts** (_having 4 great posts in drafts from the last year)_.

I know it might be too late to enter the content creation space, but lately, I have been very much active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AashutoshRathi) and have been tweeting a lot and mainly of the tweet are Series of [#TIL](https://aashutosh.dev/til/) (Today I Learned) and I curate them using a query later on my [website](https://aashutosh.dev).

Meanwhile, I do don't want to drop the plan of completing the **big** blog posts, I have been reading and chirping (_tweeting_) a lot lately.

### Coming to the point

That brings me to the point of starting something inspired by [Seth Godin's blog](https://seths.blog/), which is to **_write more and write short pieces_** (_don't force me to tell you about your attention span_) that are easily consumable in this fast-moving space.

So, I plan to write small posts (_ideally, will come up with a pattern dividing the whole post into 4 categories_) called **"Nibble"** (_coz why not_).

#### What is Nibble?

In computing, a nibble is a four-bit aggregation or half an octet. It is also known as a half-byte or trade.

If you are already subscribed and receiving this one in your mailbox (_thanks!_), stay tuned!  
Haven't decided on frequency yet ([Twitter Poll](https://twitter.com/AashutoshRathi/status/1639617444917518341))

### Why start now?

( \* _4 years after buying the domain??_ 🤫 \*)

Well, [something](https://daily.dev/blog/seed-round) has sparked the fire in my heart, and I realized that writing content is a good _way to get criticized_ and make sure you have learned _at least_ the objective things correctly.

Also,

*   I have been enjoying writing professionally and starting to like putting more _life force_ into it for the past ~1 year.
    
*   Few of the major bummers was not able to come up with good headline, logos, or banners. I think the new cool kids' tools (MidJourney and bois) are gonna help me with that.
    
*   I have been reading more than before, and I need this to be my rough notebook on the internet 😌.
    

yeah, a bit of a selfish move. (_don't want to lose my "full-time passion, which brings me a money" job to ChatGPT_).

BTW, for the uninitiated, I have been building some finger muscles 💪🏻 writing **_Release Notes_** _(as if it were part of my JD)_ at [Regie](https://regie.ai).

And I have introduced something there called **GaaS (Good Vibes as a Service):**

which means that everything _inside the (round brackets and in italics)_ is a purely fun take to make sure you giggle while you consume the important parts and the content is sending good vibes across the globe.

### What to expect?

Well, mostly the plan is to figure out the way, but the main bits will be Tech, Dev Toolings, Life, and News that matters. (_I read almost ~12-17 newsletters every day, will try to keep this one with the least duplicate content_)

#### Credits where it's due

Thanks to [Mohit](https://only4.dev) ✨ for helping me convert the logo idea to reality and [Pushkar](https://www.thepushkarp.com/) 🤝 has been helping me push (_as the name suggests_) myself all this time for writing, so, if you don't like a post, go blame him, he might have said "LGTM 👍🏻" before I published.

Godspeed 🖖🏻
