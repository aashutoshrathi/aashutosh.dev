👋🏻 Hola! Welcome to the #4 edition of Nibble.

### News 🗞️

*   ✨ Reddit will begin charging for their scraping APIs - \[[Article](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/18/reddit-will-begin-charging-for-access-to-its-api/)\]
    
*   🚀 **NodeJS 20.0** is out - \[[Release Notes](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v20-release-announce)\] (_this time they call it "Iron", so should be tough to break now, IYKWIM_)
    
*   [Google Brain and DeepMind join forces](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/announcing-google-deepmind) to solve the biggest challenges facing humanity. (it \*seems like an alpha-\***_bet_** _to beat OpenAI in this race, not sure about the challenges facing humanity, but force sure it can solve the challenges facing existing of Google_)
    
*   [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) launches Language Models [StableLM](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM), and the good news is that you can dig up the repo and deploy your own server. (_You can go ahead and play with_ [StableLM-Tuned-Alpha-7b Chat](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-chat) _that they release recently, it's not decent-ish yet, I mean OpenAI has set the bar too high for Chat Models_)
    
*   [TypeScript 5.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-1-beta/) Beta is out (\*they have loosened up some rules, and optimized it as always so that you have RAM left for VS Code and Chrome & breaking changes are "\***ES2020 and Node.js 14.17**" _are minimum requirements_)
    
*   Kent Beck, OG behind Agile Manifesto and TDD [worries a little about AI advancements](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/90-of-my-skills-are-now-worth-0) and their effect on Software Industry but concludes that you shouldn't worry as it can't replace our stupid human mistakes 😌.

### Wild World & Web 🫠

*   🏝️ You have been to this island a ton of times, but it doesn't exist, [Null Island](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/null-island-is-one-of-the-most-visited-places-on-earth-too-bad-it-doesnt-exist) (_TLDR; it is a fictional place that is located at the coordinates 0°N, 0°E. Since_ `null` _is_ `0` _in most programming languages and_ `0` _is the placeholder/default location, so all errors or missing locations point to this._)
    
    ![Welcome to Null Island, where lost data goes to die - Big Think](https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Google-Earth-Ruland-Kolen.png?w=1497)
    
*   [19k new undersea volcanoes were discovered](https://www.science.org/content/article/it-s-just-mind-boggling-more-19-000-undersea-volcanoes-discovered), making it a total of more than ~43k. ()
    
*   ♾️ Don't know what to read, but want to scroll through some good content over the web, well [WikiScroll](https://wikiscroll.blankenship.io/), brings infinite scrollable Wikipedia for you. (_if you are going to this site, there is seriously something troubling with you, get yourself checked, thanks!_)
    

### Catch up 🤓

*   😶‍🌫️ [**How to train your own LLM**](https://blog.replit.com/llm-training?ck_subscriber_id=1652259708)**,** a guide by Replit.
    
*   Cool folks at [ui.dev](https://ui.dev/) have created a **_visual learning to React_** guide and bought a really expensive domain [react.gg](https://react.gg/)
    
*   Codeium says out loud that "[Copilot spits out GPL code](https://codeium.com/blog/copilot-trains-on-gpl-codeium-does-not)", while Codeium doesn't. (_Basically, folks at Codeium say that we don't train over non-permissive code, hence we don't generate that code._)
    

### TILs 🤯

*   [Collective effervescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_effervescence) is an eye-catching name for the magic of shared experience and moving in unison.
    
    ![Collective effervescence illustration: two people hold their phones up as lights with 1000s of others in a stadium concert at night](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/5wznL7UvC7-hkYS_kFTaj0-vzjk8DTI4qqSjKttupK7z0qrbaXLWEQmwLNaNed09sWtjNPqxXo_qNwbx2S0p-Bt-Psg3qmtSXBGFoYTLkAmZaiJVYD4OhrAbpamRc3er9vgMOcSmq9mhO7i8b4oA4NQHsUQ583apIe7vY2zFO509aseDsyyIAnvBv9VMcmAqECXSkIgsgnYsJBOT92ZhIxmPhibJLJnogcrITgHGWblcm6c=s0-d-e1-ft#https://images.prismic.io/sketchplanations/00f79e4c-a5e6-4c54-b785-456c330f299e_SP+818+-+Collective+effervescence.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&w=992&q=50)
    
*   📧 You can **email yourself from Google Sheets** \[[Post](https://blog.bettersheets.co/simply-email-yourself-from-a-google-sheet/)\] (_we have had long chats on the internet about how half the software is just replacing the spreadsheets, but with LLMs and Plugins, the things that spreadsheets can't do is also reducing every day. Beware YC Startups!_)
