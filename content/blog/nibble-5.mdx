### Wild World & Web 🫠

*   😵‍💫 Gravity may have shaken space-time so hard that it spontaneously created radiation (light). \[[**Article**](https://phys.org/news/2023-04-physicists-gravity.html)\] (_every day we get closer to the secret sauce of this universe_ **_and_** _farther away from God_)

The goal of the project is to create as huge an animation as possible, with many references to movies, games, anime, and memes. (_I found Dr. Hugh from House treating the back of Kakashi Sensei from Naruto_ 🤯)

    Well, [**Matt Welsh**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Welsh_\(computer_scientist\)) says "no more than 3 years", it'll change as we know it and Co-pilot might soon take the main seat.
    
*   👀 Code Reviews are hard, but the best way to learn uncharted code, apart from breaking it. [**Kamran**](https://twitter.com/kamranahmedse) (_the person behind_ [**_Developer Roadmaps_**](https://roadmap.sh/)_)_ released a quick new guide on how to [**Review Code**](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/code-reviews)

*   Egypt is in North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia \[[**Article**](https://worldtravelfamily.com/where-is-egypt-located/)\].  
    Not every place gets the privilege to be part of three landmass regions. (_those crazy aliens didn't make the Pyramids at those co-ordinates, for no reason_)
    
*   `<StrictMode>` renders `App` **_twice_** **in only develop** mode \[[**SO Link**](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61897567/7326407)\] (_for ~15 mins, it was very confusing, I spun up a fresh CodeSandbox to check and found this out._)

### Recommendations 💫

*   [**Map of Reddit**](https://anvaka.github.io/map-of-reddit/?x=18239&y=12514&z=46488.09635705632&v=2) - if you ever found it difficult to explore Reddit (_any human should)_ this tool gives you beautiful

### Cool OSS Projects 🤌🏻

*   [**Track Anything**](https://github.com/gaomingqi/Track-Anything) - It's more or less now a ritual to talk about [SAM](https://segment-anything.com/) (_sometimes Altman, sometimes the model by Meta_) in every edition. This cool project lets you track and segment objects in a video, it uses SAM (_the model_) and XMem
    
*   [**art-of-command-line**](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) - A one-page README to master CLI commands. (_but yeah who needs it after Copilot CLI? Well, trust me, I have been using it for 2 months now, and it is better if you learn these basics_)
    
*   [**cobe**](https://github.com/shuding/cobe) - 5kb WebGL Globe Lib, which _improves perf by_ **_\>60%_**. ([**How it was made?**](https://twitter.com/shuding_/status/1475916082875666441?s=20)) (_optimizations are hard, and UI optimizations are harder, as it involves engines and renderers beyond your scope of tasks, so when you hear WebGL & optimizations in the same line, you gotta respect that._)
